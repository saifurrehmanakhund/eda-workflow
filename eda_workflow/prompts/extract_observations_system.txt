# TODO: Write the system prompt for extracting observations.
#
# This prompt should instruct the LLM to extract concise, actionable
# observations from analysis results. Use markdown sections to structure
# your prompt (e.g., # Role, # Task, # Instructions, # Constraints).
#
# Refer to synthesize_findings_system.txt as an example of a well-structured
# system prompt.
